2,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05004,"R-Zero is a novel framework for training large language models (LLMs) to self-evolve from zero external data, eliminating the need for human-curated tasks and labels. The framework consists of a Challenger and a Solver, both initialized from the same base LLM, which co-evolve through a reinforcement learning process. The Challenger generates synthetic questions targeted at the edge of the Solver's capabilities, while the Solver is fine-tuned on a filtered set of these challenging questions. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum, resulting in substantial improvements in reasoning capabilities across different backbone LLMs. For instance, R-Zero boosts the Qwen3-4B-Base model by +6.49 on math reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks. The framework is model-agnostic and can act as a mid-training method, and it has been shown to have synergy with supervised fine-tuning.
